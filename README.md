## About This Project

The code in this repository models the fast-roll mechanism in a non-canonical inflation scenario to calculate the power spectrum of primordial perturbations. The results are then used to analyze the formation of primordial black holes and the spectrum of induced gravitational waves.

## Instructions for Use

The main analysis is contained in a Mathematica notebook, which requires several external data files (`.DAT`) to run.

**1. How to Run:**
   * After downloading, place the `.DAT` files in the same directory as the Mathematica notebook (`.nb` file).
   * Open the notebook in Mathematica to run the analysis and reproduce the results from the paper.
